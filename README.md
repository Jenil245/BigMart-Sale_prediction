# EDA_and_ML
<h2>Project LifeCycle</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>EDA</b>: I explored data to see whether there is a duplication of data, null values, outliers, count distribution of categorical data </li>
<li>
  <b>DATA VISUALIZATION</b>: I visualized data with python seaborn-package which allows to create very good chart for statistical analysis.
  I researched relationship between feature variable and target variable.</li>
  <li>
    <b>FEATURE ENGINEERING</b>: I used various techniques to transform data so that it can be fed into model which are scaling, normalization, encoding, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>MODEL DEVELOPEMENT</b>:
  I used XGBoost algorithm which is a very powerful ensemble boosting approach. I performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.  </li></ul>
